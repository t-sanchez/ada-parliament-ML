## Abstract
## Data description
## Feasibility and Risks
### Data scraping
### Topic modelling 
The official bulletins do not contain any clear *topic* attribute. Our first task will be to establish the thematic of each object discussed at the parliament. To this end, we will use NLP tools. Note that we will need to establish as well how the object is presented, e.g. if voting yes to an article about immigration wants to encourage immigration in Switzerland of wants to restrict it. 
### Voting profile
If time allows, after establishing the topic of the object that is voted, we will construct a voting profile for each of the members of the parliament, as well as the parties. We will then implemented an algorithm which will attempt to predict the outcome of vote on a given matter for each party.

## Deliverables
The final result will take the form of an online website presenting different interactive visualisations of the results we obtain. The website will mostly be developped by this [team](https://github.com/jmuth/parliament-viz.ch/blob/master/README.md).
